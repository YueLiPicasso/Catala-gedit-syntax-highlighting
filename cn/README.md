# Support Chinese as a Catala Surface Language

This is the file necessary for Catala to recognize Chinese keywords. However, the lexer at the moment cannot recognize identifiers and constructors in Chinese, nor is a way to distinguish them based on character cases (lower vs. upper case). 

There is a further challenge of generating Chinese LaTeX docs, for the document class and packages needed may be different from those for Latin-1 languages.
